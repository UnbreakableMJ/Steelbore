**Steelbore** is a hardened, high-performance computing environment that abstracts the operating system. By viewing Linux, BSD, Microkernels, and the Redox kernel as variable runtimes, Steelbore provides a unified, memory-safe userland built mainly & mostly on the **Rust** programming language.

## 🐆 The Fleet (17 Flavors)
Steelbore operates as a **Distroless Ecosystem**. Regardless of the architecture—be it Monolithic, Hybrid, or Microkernel—the interface, security protocols, and visual HUD remain identical.

| Category | Flavors | Primary Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flagship** | **S3cure**, **Velocity (Cheetah)** | Fedora Atomic, CachyOS (x86-64-v3) |
| **Experimental** | **Redox**, **Hurd**, **Minix** | Pure-Rust, Multi-server, Self-healing |
| **Production** | **Pop**, **Snap**, **Forge**, **Prime** | Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, Gentoo, AerynOS |
| **Functional** | **NIX**, **Guix** | NixOS, GNU Guix (Functional Logic) |
| **Light/Mobile** | **Alpine**, **ChromOS** | Lightweight musl, ChromeOS Sentinel |
| **Industrial** | **Free**, **Open**, **Net**, **Dragon** | The BSD Tier (Security/Reliability) |

## 🛡️ The S3cure Protocol

* **DNS Filtering:** Every edition offer a choice for DNS Malware protection and more with **S3cure.us DNS**, Cloudflare, and AdGuard.
* **Memory Safety:** Legacy C-based tools are replaced by a Rust-native stack (`nu`, `brush`, `eza`, `rg`, `bat`, `fd`, `dust`, `btm`).
* **Architecture Agnostic:** The Steelbore userland is designed to bridge the gap between legacy monolithic kernels and modern microkernel theory.

## 🎨 Visual Identity
Inspired by the cold blue future of  machine intelligence (**The Matrix / Terminator**), the Steelbore aesthetic is strictly enforced across all editions.

* **Palette:** Charcoal Navy (`#0E141D`), Midnight Blue (`#142E46`), Vibrant Orange (`#FE6B00`).
* **Typography:** **x** for branding; **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** for the TUI.
* **Editor Sync:** Standardized **Vim-mode** across *Helix, msedit, Zed, Lapce, Antigravity, VSCode OSS, and emacs-ng.*

*Cutting through complexity to reach a core of pure, memory-safe stability.*
